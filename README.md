## How It Works

TabSnoop leverages Chrome's extension APIs to achieve its tracking functionality.

### Key Components:

* **`background.js`**:
    * Manages the core logic for tab activity monitoring.
    * Listens to `chrome.tabs.onActivated` and `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` events to detect active tab changes.
    * Uses `chrome.idle.onStateChanged` to pause tracking when the user is idle, ensuring accurate time measurement.
    * Persistently stores aggregated time data in `chrome.storage.local`.

* **`popup.html` & `popup.js`**:
    * The user interface (UI) that appears when the extension icon is clicked.
    * `popup.js` retrieves stored time data from `chrome.storage.local`.
    * Dynamically renders the time spent on each domain using `Chart.js` for visualizations and populates the ranked list.
    * Provides functionality for clearing all stored data.

* **`utils.js`**:
    * Contains helper functions, such as `formatTime` for converting seconds into a human-readable format.

## üõ°Ô∏è Data & Privacy

TabSnoop is designed with user privacy as a top priority.

* **Local Storage Only:** All Browse data is processed and stored **exclusively within your browser's local storage**.
* **No External Transmission:** No data is transmitted to external servers, collected by the extension developer, or shared with any third parties.
* **Complete Control:** You have full control over your data, including the option to clear all stored information at any time.
